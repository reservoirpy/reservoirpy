Reservoir Computing architectures from the literature with ReservoirPy
======================================================================

This folder contains reproduction of some results from the literature, using ReservoirPy's tools.

Content
=======

- `Improving reservoir using Intrinsic Plasticity <https://github.com/reservoirpy/reservoirpy/tree/master/examples/Improving%20reservoirs%20using%20Intrinsic%20Plasticity>`_:

A notebook presenting Intrinsic Plasticity mechanism applied to Reservoirs, as presented by Schrauwen
*et al.* in 2008 [1]_ and Triesch in 2005 [2]_.

- `Next Generation Reservoir Computing <https://github.com/reservoirpy/reservoirpy/tree/master/examples/Next%20Generation%20Reservoir%20Computing>`_:

A notebook presenting Non-linear Vector AutoRegressive machines, a particular flavor of Reservoir, as introduced
by Gauthier, Bollt and Griffith in 2021 [3]_.

- `Interactive reservoir computing for chunking information streams <https://github.com/reservoirpy/reservoirpy/tree/master/examples/Interactive%20reservoir%20computing%20for%20chunking%20information%20streams>`_:

This notebook is work-in-progress about the work from Asabuki, Hiratani and Fukai about unsupervised chunking of
timeseries, presented in 2018 [4]_.

Contributions
=============

Contributions are welcome! If you reproduced some important results from the literature using ReservoirPy, do not
hesitate to submit a pull request, we will be happy to count you as a contributor to ReservoirPy.

Disclaimer
==========

These reproductions may not be complete or follow exactly the original paper or implementation. They
are simply provided as demonstration of RC techniques and ReservoirPy capacities.
