Advanced installation guide
===========================

This page will guide you into installing ReservoirPy on your system.

Before any package installation, make sure that you have a compatible Python distribution already installed
on your computer. **ReservoirPy is meant to be used only with Python 3.6 and higher**.

If you are using Python 2, we recommend that you install a more recent version of Python,
as the support of Python 2 ended in January 2019.

To check the version of your Python distribution, you can run the following command in a terminal,
in Linux/MacOS/Windows :

.. code-block::

    python --version

When performing the installation of ReservoirPy and all its dependencies, we also recommend using a
virtual environment to avoid any unintended interactions with the dependencies that are already installed
on your system. To learn more about virtual environment, you can check `Python documentation on virual
environments and packages <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html>`_, or the documentation of the
`conda environment manager <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html>`_
if you are using Anaconda.


Installation using `pip`
========================

ReservoirPy package is hosted by `Pypi <https://pypi.org/project/reservoirpy/>`_ and can
therefore be installed using `pip` on Linux/MacOS/Windows (in the latter case, having an
`Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual>`_ distribution installed
on your computer may be necessary).

To install ReservoirPy using `pip`, simply run the following command in a terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install reservoirpy


To check your installation of ReservoirPy, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip show reservoirpy
    python -c "from reservoirpy import __version__; print(__version__)"


Installation using the source code
==================================

You can find the source code of ReservoirPy on `GitHub (https://github.com/reservoirpy/reservoirpy)
<https://github.com/reservoirpy/reservoirpy>`_.

Dowload the latest version on the ``master`` branch, or any other branch you would like
to install (``dev`` branch or older versions branches). You can also fork the project from
GitHub.

Then, unzip the project (or clone the forked repository). You can then install ReservoirPy in
editable mode using `pip` :

.. code-block::

    pip install -e /path/to/reservoirpy


Additional dependencies and requirements
========================================

  **Hyperoptimization and visualization tools**

  All basic dependencies of ReservoirPy should be installed when using `pip` as package manager.

  Although, to use the hyperoptimization and visualization tools, you will need to install a few
  more dependencies in your virutal environment, namely `hyperopt`, `matplotlib` and `seaborn`:

  .. code-block::

      pip install hyperopt matplotlib seaborn

  **Development tools**

  ReservoirPy use `pytest` as test framework, and `flake8` as linter.
  If you want to contribute to ReservoirPy, you should have the following
  additional dependencies installed:

  .. code-block::

      pip install pytest pytest-cov flake8
