    """Link two :py:class:`~.Node` instances to form a :py:class:`~.Model`
    instance. `node1` output will be used as input for `node2` in the
    created model. This is similar to a function composition operation:

    .. math::

        model(x) = (node1 \\circ node2)(x) = node2(node1(x))

    You can also perform this operation using the ``>>`` operator::

        model = node1 >> node2

    Or using this function::

        model = link(node1, node2)

    -`node1` and `node2` can also be :py:class:`~.Model` instances. In this
    case, the new :py:class:`~.Model` created will contain all nodes previously
    contained in all the models, and link all `node1` outputs to all `node2`
    inputs. This allows to chain the  ``>>`` operator::

        step1 = node0 >> node1  # this is a model
        step2 = step1 >> node2  # this is another

    -`node1` and `node2` can finally be lists or tuples of nodes. In this
    case, all `node1` outputs will be linked to all `node2` inputs. You can
    still use the ``>>`` operator in this situation, except for many-to-many
    nodes connections::

        # many-to-one
        model = [node1, node2, ..., node] >> node_out
        # one-to-many
        model = node_in >> [node1, node2, ..., node]
        # ! many-to-many requires to use the `link` method explicitly!
        model = link([node1, node2, ..., node], [node1, node2, ..., node])

    Parameters
    ----------
        left : Node, Model or list of Node
            Nodes or lists of nodes to link.
        right : Node, Model or list of Node
            Nodes or lists of nodes to link.

    Returns
    -------
        Model
            A :py:class:`~.Model` instance chaining the nodes.

    Raises
    ------
        TypeError
            Dimension mismatch between connected nodes: `left` output
            dimension if different from `right` input dimension.
            Reinitialize the nodes or create new ones.

    Notes
    -----

        Be careful to how you link the different nodes: `reservoirpy` does not
        allow to have circular dependencies between them::

            model = node1 >> node2  # fine
            model = node1 >> node2 >> node1  # raises! data would flow in
                                             # circles forever...
