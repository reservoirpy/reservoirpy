    """Link two :py:class:`~.Node` instances to form a :py:class:`~.Model`
    instance. `node1` output will be used as input for `node2` in the
    created model. This is similar to a function composition operation:

    .. math::

        model(x) = (node1 \\circ node2)(x) = node2(node1(x))

    You can also perform this operation using the ``>>`` operator::

        model = node1 >> node2

    Or using this function::

        model = link(node1, node2)

    -`node1` and `node2` can also be :py:class:`~.Model` instances. In this
    case, the new :py:class:`~.Model` created will contain all nodes previously
    contained in all the models, and link all `node1` outputs to all `node2`
    inputs. This allows to chain the  ``>>`` operator::

        step1 = node0 >> node1  # this is a model
        step2 = step1 >> node2  # this is another

    -`node1` and `node2` can finally be lists or tuples of nodes. In this
    case, all `node1` outputs will be linked to a :py:class:`~.Concat` node to
    concatenate them, and the :py:class:`~.Concat` node will be linked to all
    `node2` inputs. You can still use the ``>>`` operator in this situation,
    except for many-to-many nodes connections::

        # many-to-one
        model = [node1, node2, ..., node] >> node_out
        # one-to-many
        model = node_in >> [node1, node2, ..., node]
        # ! many-to-many requires to use the `link` method explicitly!

    Parameters
    ----------
        node1, node2 : _Node or list of _Node
            Nodes or lists of nodes to link.
        name: str, optional
            Name for the chaining Model.

    Returns
    -------
        Model
            A :py:class:`~.Model` instance chaining the nodes.

    Raises
    ------
        TypeError
            Dimension mismatch between connected nodes: `node1` output
            dimension if different from `node2` input dimension.
            Reinitialize the nodes or create new ones.

    Notes
    -----

        Be careful to how you link the different nodes: `reservoirpy` does not
        allow to have circular dependencies between them::

            model = node1 >> node2  # fine
            model = node1 >> node2 >> node1  # raises! data would flow in

) -> _Node:
    """Create a feedback connection between the `feedback` node and `node`.
    Feedbacks nodes will be called at runtime using data from the previous
    call.

    This is not an in-place operation by default. This function will copy `node`
    and then sets the copy `_feedback` attribute as a reference to `feedback`
    node. If `inplace` is set to `True`, then `node` is not copied and the
    feedback is directly connected to `node`. If `feedback` is a list of nodes
    or models, then all nodes in the list are first connected to a
    :py:class:`~.Concat` node to create a model gathering all data from all nodes
    in a single feedback vector.

     You can also perform this operation using the ``<<`` operator::

        node1 = node1 << node2
        # with feedback from a Model
        node1 = node1 << (fbnode1 >> fbnode2)
        # with feedback from a list of nodes or models
        node1 = node1 << [fbnode1, fbnode2, ...]

    Which means that a feedback connection is now created between `node1` and
    `node2`. In other words, the forward function of `node1` depends on the
    previous output of `node2`:

    .. math::
        \\mathrm{node1}(x_t) = \\mathrm{node1}(x_t, \\mathrm{node2}(x_{t - 1}))

    You can also use this function to define feedback::

        node1 = link_feedback(node1, node2)
        # without copy (node1 is the same object throughout)
        node1 = link_feedback(node1, node2, inplace=True, name="n1_copy")

    Parameters
    ----------
    node : Node
        Node receiving feedback.
    feedback : _Node
        Node or Model sending feedback
    inplace : bool, defaults to False
        If `True`, then the function returns a copy of `node`.
    name : str, optional
        Name of the copy of `node` if `inplace` is `True`.

    Returns
    -------

    Raises
    ------
        TypeError

    :py:class:`~.Node` instances contained in the models to merge will be

    between them, if they exists.

    You can also perform this operation using the ``&`` operator::

    Parameters
    ----------
